This the setup for my customized Ublue-Kinoite image, using the BlueBuild toolkit.

## Idea

Eventhough the Ublue project creates outstanding tooling, there is always something to wish for. In 2022 I already made a number of adapted images, but that got shelved after some time.
Now, with the availability of KDE Plasma 6, it is time to revive it and remake that slimmed down image.
Stay tuned!
